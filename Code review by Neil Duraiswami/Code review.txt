Upon reviewing your code, it's evident that you've prioritized user experience, which is commendable. However, I recommend strengthening error handling with validation checks to handle edge cases effectively. Your code's structure is well-organized, but ensuring scalability is crucial for future enhancements. Abstracting functionalities into separate modules or classes can facilitate this. Security in user authentication should be a top priority, ensure it aligns with industry standards to protect user data. Your commitment to testing and documentation is appreciated; continue this rigor to enhance code reliability. Overall, your contributions demonstrate a solid understanding of software development principles. Incorporating these suggestions will further enhance the quality and robustness of your codebase. Feel free to reach out for any clarifications.
